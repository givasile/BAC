# BAC
Bayesian Analysis Course

This course is a introduction to Bayesian analysis,
covering both theoretical foundations and practical applications.

The course has limited novel content; it is primarily a collection of 
existing open-source materials and resources (see #Material below),
organized and presented in a coherent manner.

# Course Structure

The course is structured into 6 main modules:

# Course Description

- What will you learn?
  
  This course offers a solid foundation in Bayesian analysis, combining theoretical insights with hands-on applications. You will learn how to model uncertainty, perform inference, and apply Bayesian methods to real-world problems such as Bayesian regression.

- What will you be able to do by the end of the course?
  - By the end of the course, you will be able to:
  - Work confidently with probabilities and random variables.
  - Approach data analysis through probabilistic modeling and answer scientific questions using probabilistic inference.
  - Understand the principles of Bayesian modeling and distinguish it from other probabilistic approaches.
  - Perform Bayesian inference using both exact methods (e.g., conjugate priors) and approximate methods (e.g., MCMC, Laplace approximation, importance sampling).
  - Implement Bayesian linear and logistic regression models.
  - Use R to carry out Bayesian modeling and inference.
  - Apply Bayesian techniques to real-world problems, including regression and classification tasks.

- Course prerequisites:
  - Basic understanding of probability and statistics.
  - Familiarity with R programming language is beneficial but not required.
  
# Course Format

The course is split in 6 sessions of 1.5h, each consisting of a theoretical part (about 45 minutes) and a practical part (about 45 minutes).
The theoretical part introduces the theoretical concepts and the exercises provide hands-on experience with the concepts covered in the theory. 
The exercises can be either pen-and-paper or implemented in R, depending on the session.
The first three sessions focus on the theoretical foundations of Bayesian analysis, while the last three sessions are dedicated to practical applications and hands-on exercises.


# Material

This course is built upon the following open-source materials:

- [MLPR Course - University of Edinburgh](https://mlpr.inf.ed.ac.uk/2024/): 
  The course is an amazing general introductory resource in Machine Learning. 
  It is the course I took as postgraduate student at UoE back in 2019, and it inspired me to work in this field.
  
- [PMR Course - University of Edinburgh](https://opencourse.inf.ed.ac.uk/pmr):
  The course provides a thorough understanding of statistical/probabilistic machine learning and Bayesian inference.

- [Bayes Rules! An Introduction to Applied Bayesian Modeling](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/):
  This book is a great resource for learning Bayesian modeling and inference, with practical examples and applications in R and Stan.
  
- [Multivariate Statistics](https://11annah-s-teachings.github.io/)
  Amazing open-source resource that covers the fundamentals of Multivariate Statistics, Probability Theory and Linear Algebra.
