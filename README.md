# BAC
Bayesian Analysis Course

This course is a introduction to Bayesian analysis,
covering both theoretical foundations and practical applications.

The course has limited novel content; it is primarily a collection of 
existing open-source materials and resources (see #Material below),
organized and presented in a coherent manner.

# Course Structure

The course is structured into 6 main modules:

| Module    | Description                                                        | Material                      | Exercises                        |

| Session 2 | Probabilities and Random Variables                                 | [pdf](./session_2/theory.pdf) | [pdf](./session_2/exercises.pdf) |

| Session 5 | Bayesian Logistic Regression                                       | [pdf](./session_5/theory.pdf) | [pdf](./session_5/exercises.pdf) |
| Session 6 | Bayesian Modeling with R                                           | [pdf](./session_6/theory.pdf) | [pdf](./session_6/exercises.pdf) |

# Material

This course is built upon the following open-source materials:

- [MLPR Course - University of Edinburgh](https://mlpr.inf.ed.ac.uk/2024/): 
  The course is an amazing general introductory resource in Machine Learning. 
  It is the course I took as postgraduate student at UoE back in 2019, and it inspired me to work in this field.
  
- [PMR Course - University of Edinburgh](https://opencourse.inf.ed.ac.uk/pmr):
  The course provides a thorough understanding of statistical/probabilistic machine learning and Bayesian inference.

- [Bayes Rules! An Introduction to Applied Bayesian Modeling](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/):
  This book is a great resource for learning Bayesian modeling and inference, with practical examples and applications in R and Stan.
  
- [Multivariate Statistics](https://11annah-s-teachings.github.io/)
  Amazing open-source resource that covers the fundamentals of Multivariate Statistics, Probability Theory and Linear Algebra.
