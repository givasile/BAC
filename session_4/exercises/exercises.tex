\section*{Exercises}
You are provided with a file named \texttt{exercises.R},
which contains all the code we used for generating the example I showed you in the slides.
However, there are some missing parts in the code,
which are marked with the tag  \texttt{@exercise}.

For example:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=R, caption={Example of an exercise in the code}]
  # @exercise: Complete the following function
  # Sampled lines from prior:
  # mean = 0, sigma = Sigma_prior
  # @exercise
  # prior_samples <- ...  # Sampled lines from prior, shape (30, 2)
\end{lstlisting}
You need to complete the code in the file \texttt{exercises.R} by filling in the missing parts.
